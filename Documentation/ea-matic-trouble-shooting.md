# EA-Matic Trouble Shooting

When things do not work you may be forced to restart Sparx EA. This may be because EA-Matic is using a stale verion of you VBScript.

Things like incorrect syntax or errors being thrown can be the cause of this issue.

If you follow [EA-Matic Guidelines](./ea-matic-guidelines.md) there should be less opportunity for things to go wrong.
